### About 360Snoozin
We're a team of developers working together as part of the [College of Charleston](http://cofc.edu/) CSCI 360, Software Architecture and Design course. Our goal is to develop a Dual-Alarm AM/FM Clock Radio in [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) while learning about [System Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design) and [AGILE Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).
